# 🛡️ Autonomous Hybrid Control Drone Swarm for Threat Detection and Defense

An advanced **AI-driven autonomous drone swarm** system designed for **real-time threat detection, situational awareness, and cooperative defense** operations.  
This project integrates **hybrid control mechanisms** — combining **centralized intelligence** and **distributed autonomy** — enabling drones to coordinate seamlessly in dynamic and hostile environments.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern defense and surveillance require **intelligent, adaptive, and cooperative UAV systems**.  
This project focuses on building a **hybrid swarm control framework** that allows multiple drones to operate both independently and collaboratively under a unified AI coordination layer.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **hybrid control framework** for drone swarms (central + distributed control).  
- Implement **AI-based threat detection** using onboard vision systems.  
- Enable **autonomous decision-making** for pursuit, defense, or evasion.  
- Achieve **real-time communication and coordination** between multiple UAVs.  
- Optimize swarm efficiency through **reinforcement learning and swarm intelligence**.
